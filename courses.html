        In this class, a group of 8 students and I had a project of making a self navigating robot that could navigate a maze like that shown in the video below. The robot was able to send a radio signal of its current location as well as the location of an infrared emitter located on the maze.

We will cover several unsupervised, and supervised learning techniques. Supervised learning includes regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, naïve bayes, boosting and bagging. Unsupervised learning includes clustering, k-means, k-NN, principal components analysis and other dimensionality reduction methods. We will also cover Mixture of Gaussians, the EM algorithm, and the Viterbi algorithm. We will give particular emphasis on applications in ECE, e.g., text data, hand-writing, music, image, and time series data, and categorical datasets such those in recommendation systems. The course will have a programming component, which will be administered in the form of assignments, or in-class-kaggle competitions.
